- The way we did it, the vernacular of the next element is somewhat misleading.
Instead, we had dummy point to the node that we want to return the cargo of, then
point the dummy pointer to the next node, and then return the cargo of the previous
element.
- The reason we did this was to avoid missing either the first or last elements
whenever we ran a FOREACH loop.
