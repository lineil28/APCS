DISCO:
- Modifying the stacks for ArrayLists and LinkedLists only required changing the structure
of the methods (e.g. using .add instead of having to write an add ourselves for arrays).
- Adding or removing from the ArrayList did not modify the _stackSize, so we still needed
to change _stackSize as necessary.
- Because we were only adding and removing at the top of the stack instead of at arbitrary
positions in the stack, we think that ArrayLists might generally work better with stacks
than LinkedLists, since the main advantage of LinkedLists is being able to modify the
collection easier and ArrayLists have the advantage of getting specific elements easier.

QCC:
- When to use LLStacks instead of ALStacks, or vice versa?
